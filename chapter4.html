        While all previous chapters are talking about times we spent together and the amazing times we had with each other, one should also not
        forget that we actually spent more time apart from each other than together. During that time, we showed each other a lot of love, had fun and laughs
        together and did our best to keep the relationship alive by contacting each other basically every single day of our relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lovely times we sent each other kisses before starting into the day or leaving for an event, not only to keep each other updated but also to 
        show each other love and our appearence on a regular basis.

        Even I, who never takes selfies or pictures, tried my best to share my life with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite my greatest efforts to show you love and make you laugh, I am still not very good at it haha.
        But I promise that I will do my best to improve, and I will take in the future more pictures of myself
        for you and will urge you also that we take more pictures of us when we are together.

        I am missing you every single second I cannot be with you. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So even when I am with my friends I am trying to show you love and I am actively trying to engage my friends in it haha.
        As they are better in taking pictures it might be even something good! I shared with all of my friends how great my
        girlfriend is and they all loved to participate in a small but lovely act for you.

        These days I am trying to get myself into cosmetics and beauty products which I can share with you and even send to you.
        Not because I love to spend money or I want to buy your love. It is because from a distance there are very few things I can do
        for you. I cannot help you in your daily routine as your work is confidential and I cannot help anyways. I cannot help cleaning
        your house as I am too far away. I cannot help you with other problems for the same reasons. The only thing I can actively do for you,
        besides always being there for you, is to ensure that when you have a moment of time for yourself, you have the greatest products available
        to rest, recover, release stress and be even prettier the next day. Therefore, I will continue my efforts and therefore I sent you the package
        with the beauty masks which you were supposed to have today already. Bad customs :(( bad DHL :((
      </p>
      <p>
        I am even applying the masks myself to get a better feeling for it and share some love with you haha

        In addition, receiving a picture from you with mask on and wearing a cute headband makes me deeply happy everytime <3
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish I could be there with you, help you relax, share a massage with you, and fall asleep together with you in my arms. As the thing
        I miss the most about being with you is not sex or your caring nature, it is falling asleep with you in my arms, as this is the best feeling
        in the whole wide world.
