        In March we finally were able to meet again in the amazing city of Bangkok.
      </p>
      <p>
        You showed me around the city, we walked a lot together searching for gaming stores, cosmetics, special food and others.
        But the greatest memory about walking randomly around is the search for 7/11, which was supposed to be close to us but we walked
        for 20 minutes because I did not know where to go haha. I remember you asked me on the way: "Do you like Bananas? Do you like cake?
        Then I have the perfect thing for you! My favorite Banana cake haha" You were so sweet and cute at the moment and also so funny and caring,
        I really enjoyed this journey together.

        You brought me then to a mall not far from our hotel, in which we had amazing food and ice cream and even watched a hot-dog
        eating competition. Bangkok was great and the time with you there is unforgettable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Close to the mall was also a great night market which we visited once and you recommended me to try the delicious fruit juice.
        We strolled through the streets and enjoyed life together. It was wonderful, despite the hot weather.

        One day you took me to a big night market with a beautiful scenerey and many stores and restaurants.
        The view on the river and the atmosphere and temperature was perfect for a romantic night out and our
        relationship was destined to grow stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went to this amazing pizza place with live music, where I was very worried at first that you will not
        like the pizza I ordered. The pizza was delicious and we had a great time listening to the live band.
        I asked the lady to play "John Legend - All of Me" for you and she accepted my request. Her singing was 
        great, but during her singing I could only focus on you, as you were not only beautiful but also amazing
        and fun at that time, and I could not resist to grow more and more fond of you.

        We had overall a lot of fun in Bangkok and grew more and more fond of each other. Not only the night markets, the
        game store hunts and the amazing food was great with you, but we also went to the cinema together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was really amazed by the kind of movies you like and I knew that we can spent many great evenings together.
        We both were additionally amazed by the clip of the Thai King, that is being played before every movie in the
        cinema in Thailand haha.

        You even took me to McDonalds as I was craving for burger and wanted to see what the local Thai McDonalds burger was. Despite having
        an argument during the meal you were still lovely and caring. I am really sorry for my insensivity as I did not know better at that
        time =((. But you continued through and we had an amazing time.
      </p>
      <p>
        While all that was going on, our physical attraction grew also stronger and we were both horrible at it haha. It was cute and lovely how
        we tried to show each other love, not knowing what we are exactly doing. Growing with you through that experience is one of the best 
        memories in my life and I would not trade this time for anything in the world.

        After very short few days we both needed to head back to work. It was a very sad moment as we needed to separate, not knowing when we gonna meet again.
      </p>
      <p>
        You cried at the airport and I was trying to be strong, I was not very good at showing my emotions, I never was. I wished I could have shown you 
        more emotions not only during that time. I really enjoyed the time in Thailand, I miss it and would go back immediately to it if I could. And yes, after this trip I was surely in love with you. I was just to stupid to show it or admit it.
