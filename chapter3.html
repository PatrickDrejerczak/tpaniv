        After an amazing time in Thailand, we were able to meet again in Vietnam. We had great plans of 
        joining your friends wedding, going to Danang and overall having a lot of fun together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wedding ceremony was amazing and the party afterwards was a lot of fun. The movie of you 
        preparing a dance video for the couple was fabolous. During the party I was also able to see
        your father again and share a beer with him and his friends. It was a great moment and I really
        like your father. He is a great and kind man that raised a wonderful daughter. However, the highlight
        of the party was for you. You looked so beautiful and captivating in your dress, that I did not know what to say.
        I was speechless at that time. While I was very fascinated to see you with your friends and your entire community together.
        I was also overwhelmed and scared of it, as our lives seemed to be so different. My insecurity caused us a lot of pain
        and anger that day, for which I want to apologize to you from the bottom of my heart.

        We moved then after a lot of problems to Danang, where we had a great time strolling through the city at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your friends joined us for that trip as their honeymoon and we went to Hoi An together. A beautiful traditional
        Vietnamese city in which we took many amazing pictures and enjoyed the scenery together. The night market was amazing
        and I wish we would have had more time together to spent there in cafes as there was also live music being played.

        During the time in Danang, despite many problems, fights and tears, I could feel that my love for you was growing.
        I was still not good at admitting feelings and I hurt you a lot during that time. Again, I would like to apologize from 
        that from the bottom of my heart and I have no excuses. But I would like to focus on the great fun we had together in Danang.
      </p>
      <p>
        We went to a bar together to play dart and for the first time I could see your competitive spirit firing up as you really
        enjoyed the game and developed the desire to beat me. You even made the impossible happen and beat me during that night.
        We had a lot of fun and laughter. It continued in the hotel room in which we not only shared our love but also played
        mario party and mario kart together. You are a great gamer and it was an amazing time with you. I wish we would have spent 
        more great days like this in our relationship as at times, everything seemed perfect.

        You then came to Korea to visit me on my "hometurf". I picked you up from the airport and we took the bus to my place.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spent a couple of days together and it felt like time was flying. I was trying to show you the best part of Seoul in a record
        time, while also spending quality time with you and simply enjoying life together. From horror trips to hell, to crazy trips through
        almost entire Seoul, to the lovely night we spent together in a Samsung hotel, eating delicious lamb skewers and watching a great movie
        together in a luxurious hotel room. I enjoyed every single second of us being together and we made great memories I will never forget.

        During your time in Korea I also tried to introduce you to my friends and share a bit of my life with you. You were able to meet great people
        such as Heemi, his cute bf and Fredo.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tried to show you how we play usually, with a day fully packed of walking, eating, drinking and even karaoke singing till 4AM at night haha.
        You managed to get along with my friends really well and endure the entire procedure, I was really proud to be able to introduce such an amazing
        girlfriend to my friends and they all enjoyed the time with you.

        Last but not least, I came to Bien Hoa in late February this year to surprise you and to spent some time with you after a long break.
        We spent some great evenings with your friends and also sometimes their lifely nephews haha. It was a lot of fun and I was happy to experience
        Bien Hoa the way you get to experience it everyday. Bien Hoa is an amazing city with amazing and lovely people, who helped me along the way
        even though I was a stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though we were not able to meet many times and we had our differences, it was a great time for me in which I could learn more about
        Vietnam, life in Vietnam, about you and most importantly about myself, what I want in life, with whom I want to spent it and how I want to spent it.
        Even though this time was not easy for both of us, I would not trade it for anything in the world and I want to thank you from the bottom of 
        my heart, as this experience made me realize my own flaws and mistakes and made me find my life goal and my life dream. Thank you for that babe <3
